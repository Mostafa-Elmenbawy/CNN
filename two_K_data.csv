"""Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.  The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving ""too fast for conditions"", and another 4.9% were ""too fast for curve"". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).    Now one could say, ""Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.""  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s""",1

"""If one watched that split, Vulcun also placed third, and were beaten by TSM 2-1 in the semi's, which GGU subsequently lost to in the finals 3-2.Vulcun didn't get the luxury of a B of 5 like GGU, and their series against TSM was also fairly close, much like GGU's. Arguably the 2 teams (Coast and Vulcun) could have been = in strength. Back then I was actually of the opinion that Vulcun was better than GGU, they just had to face TSM earlier than GGU did in the bracket... I don't even remember who GGU faced in semi's, but it wasn't nearly as bad as TSM, plus, Vulcun beat Curse just to get to the semis I think.  -edit Ok looking back, it's weird. Vulcun beats CLG, then beats Curse, then faces TSM in semi's... But Despite losing, Curse also plays GGU in the semis. WTF is this bracket??? GGU beats Dignitas, then beats Curse in Semi's and then faces TSM in the finals. Pretty similar paths, Vulcun had to play an extra set earlier for... reasons? wins 2 sets, then loses in a close set to TSM. GGU beats two teams in a a best of 3 then loses to TSM. Who was better? Too bad they never got a chance to play each other in the bracket, my money was on Vulcun easy. Jintae/Dude couldn't handle Mancloud/Xmithie, guarantee it.  Coast also got relegated the split right after Vulcun did, at least Vulcun could say they got relegated by LMQ... Coast got relegated by Complexity!

"""Are you talking about this?  &gt;The early 2000s recession was a decline in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation.[citation needed] Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) had already ceased in East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_2000s_recession  It takes a real prophet to forecast economic cycles. /s""",1

Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.

Normally, when someone is bad towards us, we will be bad towards them. But that's only for a game with equal players. Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.  Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line.

By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.  The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.  Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.  And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.  For example.  I believe 9/11 was an inside job.  Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.  Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.  If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.

What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players. ** That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise.   So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth.   **Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...  **2nd point**: Yes.

"""&gt; I don't believe for one second that Biz was not showing effort. That dude Breeds effort. He constantly is getting as cut as possible and is always training and always gets backed by teammates as a hard worker.  How many Hornets practices have you watched?  How many scrimmages?  How much tape?  How much have you talked to the trainers?  I'm gonna go ahead and say less than Clifford.    &gt; Being top 10 in defense doesn't mean he doesn't plays undersized line ups that lost us 4th Q leads....  I remember line ups of Kemba/Roberts/PJ/Marv/maxiell every single person is undersized in that group.  Bottom line he subbed defense for offense in the 4th and that resulted in losses.  You have to deal the cards you're dealt.  We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.    &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year  1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.    2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.    3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.  4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and ""matured"" yet in the same sentence.    &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.    ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588732257600458752)  ""[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733044938375168).""  [Clifford said the simplest measure of MKG's value is when he didn't play they didn't win.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733213343932418)  Yeah, Clifford *really* hates MKG.    /s""",1

Some may argue that since CHA and WIS apply to a similar number of skills but WIS also applies to Will saves, that makes it better. I refer those people to the feat found in totally-fair-and-not-broken-ACG which gives the Oracle Divine Grace, as the Paladin ability (add CHA to all saves in addition to their base stat), so lack of this option actually makes WIS *weaker* than CHA for the Oracle's purposes.  Another option is to play a Lore Shaman instead of a Lore Oracle. Aside from being WIS based out the gate, Lore Shaman gets a very good reason to grab a non-trivial INT score as well which feels appropriate here.

Theorists would identify the communist revolutions we've had, and argue that these were simply despots using rhetoric to forment peasant revolutions in their interests.  The masses are told this is communism, and the rhetoric (the Communist party of China, Communist Party of Cuba, etc) also plays along with that.  So I can either assign the theorists opinions I hear often from left anarchists, that all of these incarnations of so called communism aren't communism, or I can use the definition most people, the masses, the working class, would agree with.

Of these, 6,345 (86 percent) were male, and 1,042 (14 percent) were female.# The homicide rate for black victims in the United States was 20.86 per 100,000. In comparison, the overall national homicide rate was 5.30 per 100,000 and the national homicide rate for whites was 3.11 per 100,000.# For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified, 82 percent of black victims (5,743 out of 7,011) were killed with guns. Of these, 73 percent (4,204 victims) were killed with handguns. There were 701 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments, 247 victims killed by bodily force, and 200 victims killed by a blunt object. Hes betrayed his own people! It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks.

First off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible. For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science. There is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning (theoretical) and empirical testing (demonstrative). Objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter. None of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning. ********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.,0

Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists.

"On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion.Life begins at the point of conception. No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction. You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape?

The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the ""quality of life"" test. The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life. ",0

We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated. First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that.

"Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify theseThe injustice of the British ban on self defenseMaking matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he ‚Äúhas shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.‚Äù Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home ‚Äì while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve ‚Äúcivilised society‚Äù. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his ‚Äúpublic duty‚Äù to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.

As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with ""creationism"". While ""creationism"" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one ""believes"" in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution.

In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...* The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality.

But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do.

The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence.

What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",0
"i am new to the forum and was just reading through a few of the posts. i like archangel's line of reasoning here.  to take it another step, i remember reading in high school the percentages of, what elements made up the atmosphere. o, n, and about 2% of all the other elements combined. those 2% included co2 and had a number specifically attached to it. i don't remember what that number was, but if it were 'actually' showing measurable increases, why are we not all kept up to speed on how drastic the increases are? [i.e. 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124%]. i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees. so scientists started studying the ill effects of all this pollution on the trees. does anyone know what was discovered? Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.

"In a few decades, it might be possible that technological progress would develop an ""artificial womb"" that can nurture a fetus almost from day one until birth.

"I agree, no oath should be taken lightly. However, I believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential, especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into. Abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with. Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area. Following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white, when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey. In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use ""his/her"" or ""he/she""... it just gets tiring after a while...)",0

Some people believe God exists. Others do not believe God exists. Neither view can be proven based on physical evidence. Both are beliefs only. Though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true. I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God.

"A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors. Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day. I didn't know that before then. I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them. One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion. I didn't think of it at the time, but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services. I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well. If this were the case, the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal. They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use. In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion. I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that? The goal of anti-abortionist is clear.

Such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families, as the groups are commonly ranked....

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.

In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:""The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.""My reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one. If it's going to pass, it has to pass in two consecutive years, so simply taking it up in year three and saying, ""Didn't pass in two consecutive years, failed"" may be legit. I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action.

"'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status. oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.",0

"the fact is that these countries supplied trained terrorists that hijacked the planes that were used in the 9/11 attacks. the fact is that these countries are hosts of al qaeda training camps your 'proof' that iraq deserves or military onslaught is a jordanian terrorist named zarqawi operating out of iraq. he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq, and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway, you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp",0

"in florida about 7.5 million votes were cast for president. bush has the lead, with 100% reporting, by 376,923 votes. this is somewhere along the lines of a 376,386 increase in his margin of victory in fl compared to 2000.  in new mexico, approximately 700,000 votes were cast. bush has the lead, with 99% reporting, by 12,170 votes. he lost this state in 2000. the last election in which a candidate for president received a plurality was in 1984. ronald reagan carried 59% of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes. today is 2004, approximately 30 years between an election where the presidential candidate received a plurality. i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy",0

So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much.

"i can see your point, though i am confused about gay sex drive, your saying a gay man's sex drive is not feminine? is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? like being naked for example? there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him? i can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexuals interests. some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be? well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.",0

An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller.

You are correct. I did not know that S Africa had abolished the death penalty. No death penalty=no death penalty for firearms posession.    S Africa has the most restrictive gun laws on the planet. They also have the highets murder rate in the western wor So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.,0

"how so? do you mean to treat others, better than you would have others treat you? then you are merely a perpetual victim to sociopaths. people are not always following the golden rule, and that's where the social unrest and problems start. without some degree of this a society cannot function and there would be no social cohesion and there would be constant conflict without peace.  why does it serve them to do so? it's because we are social. it's mutual self-interest, sure, but the larger human need to interact with the other is always there. no one is an island. no one is completely selfless either. we preserve ourselves, so we may realize our full potential by some degree of social interaction and co-operation. so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.",0

"atheism is not a belief in the typical sense. it is a non-belief. it is the abscence of belief.  a theist is one who beleives in one form of a diety or another.  the prefix 'a' means without. thus an atheist is one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another. as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god'. i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.",0

"the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain. you have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive. it is also the processor (brain) as well as the motherboard (connector of inputs and outputs) and the ram (short term memory). there is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components. this is also the core of what determines if a computer is a mac or a pc. if you take all these pieces from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc. this is the case since you will be able to run pc-only applications and not mac-only applications. well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.",0

"that just shows how nutty it is. using your argument, someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong: apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins. the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy. religion seems to naturally arise, although there are many theories as to how and why, religious and otherwise. think of religion like morality: the idea varies, but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things. it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs. daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.",0

"Well, I'm not an atheist, but I definitely don't believe in the bible. However, I don't think the ""atheists"" or the non-christian believers promote morality. Our issue is only based in the fact that we are a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect. On the other side, the fundies say they know what's right for everyone and look at us as reprobrates, condemned... blah blah blah. Don't think we're promoting morality. we're not pedophiles, thieves or evil people.... but we're constantly condemned by the moral christianists. I think our side of the moral issue is more of a knee-jerk reaction to the jerks on the fundie side. If someone kicked you constantly, wouldn't you eventually kick back. The problem with the fundies is that when we kick back, it hurts. But they feel justified in what they do. It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be ""defending"" or ""kicking back"" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect.",0

"legislative solutions and popular appeal are not the same thing. the legislature is hired to do what's right, not what's popular. that aside, where has the gay rights movement used voting as anything except a measure of last resort? if gays knew they could count on popular support they wouldn't need to fight to get their rights protected. we know this. we also know that's there's lots of big money opposing gay rights, and sadly enough money is often the deciding factor in voting. so where is voting being used as anything other than a last ditch attempt to accomplish something for the gay rights movement? well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.",0

"i'm assuming static because that's the case i'm interested in. in real terms, i'm holding a ball; it's motionless with respect to the earth. i let go. what about warped space makes the ball move towards the earth? that's the specific question that i'm trying to get an answer to. yes, the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet. if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me. an analogy for gravity that requires gravity doesn't convince me, or explain anything to me. so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?",0

"this makes no sense. bet does not exist to be exclusive entertainment for blacks. it is ethno-centric programming. and not very good at that (tv1 is better). for there to be a 'white' channel, at least along the lines of what bet is aiming to do, there would have to be a single 'white' culture, which there isn't. and bet does not exclude whites from its programming.  your statement seems flat out racist to me. as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced. you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.",0

"so why did toe ignore horizontal gene transfer for so many decades? can you tell me how it is that gene transferred horizontally (without going through selection) validates darwinism, which says all beneficial traits must pass through selection in order to be adapted? it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.",0

"bryan makes a good point though. bloomberg is basically trying to suggest that if we got tough on gun laws here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down. this is pretty doubtful. you never really see someone go 'man, i'd xxxx your head off but guns are too expensive'. instead, people are just smart enough to get guns where it is easiest. should those 10 states suddenly become the hardest states to get guns in than you'd see 10 other states be on that list with the exact same crime rates. the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws. i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.",0

"whether the anglican church is apostolic or not is a matter of opinion. the roman church started as an imperial church. its claim to apostolic succession is dubious as well, given the nature of some of the pope's in the middle ages, who were clearly chosen by outside influences. the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth. the priest was and is well aware that i am an anglican, though we are of the same faith, christianity. so was his predecessor who i also received communion from. deviation from catholic dogma is common in the catholic church. ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?",0
"You'll have to specify which argument. My response was to your question ""Can religious views be logical?"" I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to ""miraculous"" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source.",0

"A chance mutation can do this by insertion. The codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another. This is especially likely if the genes are near eachother. Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins. Two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape. If the proteins interlock or attach, they can form new combined structures. Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens.
